## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create repository, you need to signup first at github.com. After that you will be redirected to a new page, and on the top right side click “+” , new menu will come up. Click on 'New repository'. You will be redirected to another page. On the top of  it you will see your user name followed by a forward slash ,
'user/ your repository name here '
and that's were you put your repository name. You can also add a description and choose if you want private or public repository.
At the end check the 'Initialize this repository with a README' and choose the license which will suit your project the best.
Then click a green button “Create repository” and you set all :)
To clone your project open a terminal and type : git clone git@github.com:user/my_repo.git where user is your user name and repo is your repository name.
Open source allows you to share your code with other people and let them customize it to their needs.
Before I didn't realize  how important it is to use license with open source, but now I know that it makes life easier for the contributor and users of his work. Contributor keeps copyrights and users not obliged to ask every time they want to modify their code, license says everything.
There are a few types of open source licensing , which I wasn't aware of before.
In my opinion open source is a great idea, it can help make a better software, and share it with others for free. That's why I like GNU 'General Public License',it basically allows you to do whatever you want with the software, you can even sell it, but at the same time you need to provide a link to the free version of the same software.
