I've learned how IP and DNS works, and also how I can modify DNS MX record, so I can use different mail servers if I want to.
It is really important to specify the purpose of the website and design it accordingly. Then pick the right hosting company and don't get frustrated when changing serves and the web page doesn't shows up immediately. It takes time to update DNS.
It was great feeling seeing website up and running, and adding a small piece to World Wide Web.
This chapter contains a lot of knowledge, I think it will take a while to master DNS and IP knowledge.
