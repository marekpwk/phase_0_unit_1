I learned that process of good design is much more complicated that I had thought. And the basic question is 'what problem website solves'. There is no easy answer to this, if question is addressed wrongly, the design will go in totally different direction.
I wouldn't say I hated design and users preferences, but I also wouldn't say I liked it :)
As I mentioned above, for me the hardest part was to identify the main problem the website solves.

In this chapter I've learned how to make a basic wireframe for a website and that was the part I enjoyed the most. I think that the knowledge of UX process will make communication within team members responsible for design much easier.
