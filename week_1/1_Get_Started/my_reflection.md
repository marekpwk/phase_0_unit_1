## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I didn't have any problems with setting up git or Github, because I've done it before, so this task was pretty much easy.
Git is a Version Control System. The best way to describe it is to imagine git as a time line with different versions of file on it. The best part is that with git you can go back in time, view your file from a month ago, compare to your current file, merge changes or restore original file and everything is organized nicely with no mess. It is easy to delete a file by mistake , but it is not a problem in git because you can restore file like in regular backup software. Oh... there is another analogy. Git is like backup system for your code, pictures you editing, novel you are writing and many more.
Let's say I work on a project and want to add something new, which I'm not sure will work properly. I don't want to change my original files and break my code, so I will make a branch “new-feature” and then an experiment with my new code there. No matter if I broke my code, delete files, my original files(master – branch) would be untouched. And if I decided that I liked the new feature I could easily merge it with my project.
“The branching” allows you to collaborate in a very easy and clear way, no overwriting of your coworkers files by mistake, and that's where GitHub comes in.
GitHub and git are not the same things. Github is the site where users host their git repositories, and collaborate with other people. It is like a turbocharger for git. You can collaborate with other people no matter where you or they are.
Before I first time used git, I was really wondering what's so great about it, that it is just another backup system.
I had my own system for tracking my projects, and thought that it was pretty clever, example: I kept everything in folders:
website1_02_02_2012, website1_02_23_2012, website1_03_03_2012 and so on... It is a lot of folders.
Git eliminates this cluttering, no need to make folders, git will do the work for me.
