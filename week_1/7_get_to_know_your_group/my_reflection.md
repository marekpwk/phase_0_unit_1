Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

Hi guys, my name is Marek Pyczkowski and I live in Chicago. I graduated in hmm... 2003 from University of Finance and Management in Bialystok in Poland. Most of the last decade however I've worked as a construction superintendent, supervising different construction projects.

My interest has always oscillated in the direction of technology, but my life has gone in a completely different direction, but now I'm going to change it :)

My favorite websites are as follows : Lifehacker, ArsTechnica, Edx and Google (actually not the favorite one, but most used one).

My learning style is also multi-modal. While I learn I like to have access to diverse sources, books, video lectures and of course challenges where I can apply my knowledge.
My thinking style is Abstract Random with Abstract Sequential. I was very surprised how Gregorc Model described me so accurately and also showed my weak points. One of them is to explain or justify feelings, that's why I find writing a blog as a very challenging task. It actually took me twice as much time to write reflections than work on actual challenges.

Looking forward to meet you guys in person and see you in hangout!!
