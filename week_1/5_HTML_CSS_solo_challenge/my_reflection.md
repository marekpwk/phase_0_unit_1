This challenge was a fun. I made an ugly website incorporating all of the elements specified in the exercise.
What really got me interested are pseudo-selectors. It's really convenient to be able to select n-th element of the list, style it, and all that without touching html.
I don't think I find anything in this challenge tedious, it was interesting because I could apply my knowledge right away and see the results.
