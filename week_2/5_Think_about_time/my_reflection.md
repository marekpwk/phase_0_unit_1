# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
* How will you combat that?
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

Very often I like to  jump from one exercise to another and in final I lose a lot of time and I think it can be done more effectively. I will combat this by trying to eliminate multitasking and concentrate on one exercise at the time.
The other thing I want to do is to start meditating, I've read a lot about benefits of meditation and I think this is the best time to start it.
