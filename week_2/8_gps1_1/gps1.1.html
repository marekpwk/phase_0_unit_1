          <h3>Why should we consider pair programming?</h3>

          <p id="subtitle"><strong>Our thoughts</strong></p>

          <p><em>"Pair programming can really speed up your project, but first you have to understand, how to do it the right way, and this is the hard part. From my first attempt with Guided Pair Session, I can tell that it is really important (or probably essential) to express your thoughts out loud and in a clear way, so your partner knows exactly what you want to do. It sounds obvious and simple, but its not (at least not for me).</p>

          <p>I enjoyed my first GPS session, but I realize that it is far far way from the effective pair programming, its also made me realize how big gaps I have in my communication skills, which are essential for a good programmer."</em> -Marek</p>

          <p><em>"My experiences with pair programming have been beneficial. It allows you to get insight and immediate feedback from another developer as you're working. It also opens you both up to possibilities that perhaps you hadn't considered on your own.</p>

          <p>As Marek points out, one of the key components for success in pair programing is establishing clear communication. It helps to verbalize your thought process and to check for understanding."</em> -Ernie</p>

          <p>A few more things to consider. First, a good starting point in your communication is checking in with your peer and seeing how their doing. Next, you both should discuss the driver and navigator situation. It can help to make sure you both have a similar understanding of what those roles entail. For example, typically the driver is the person who is actually typing in the code or writing out the project. The navigator on the other hand would be the person who is giving the directions and making sure you are both on the right path. You do not have to stick to one role the entire session, sometimes it can be helpful to switch off. Finally, pair programming should be enjoyable. Yes, we may have work to accomplish but make the most of it and have fun.</p>
