My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


As I mentioned in my previous reflections I find user experience quite difficult topic, but surprisingly while designing my own website I enjoyed it. I've tweaked the look of my website last week, so this week I only added navigation and I concentrated on responsive design. During website creation I was using Emmet LiveStyle plugin for Sublime, which shows css changes in the browser at the same time that you type them in, so I could see immediately if certain styling works or not.
Next thing I want to add is collapsible menu in a mobile view, but to do that I need to use JavaScript and Jquery and thats week3.
