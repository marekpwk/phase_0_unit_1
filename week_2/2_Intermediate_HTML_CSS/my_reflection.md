# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary?
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think web standards are good and necessary things to achieve cross browser compatibility and I hope, one day we won't have to worry about IE and using new HTML elements make sense.
It is better for search engines to understand content of the website and it helps to keep well-organised code. Besides most of the tags for common elements looks like this <div class = “nav”>, so why not just use “nav” by itself or a “footer” for example.
Reset.css actually resets all unwanted styling to zero. Browsers apply default styles to some elements, by including reset we are eliminating that unwanted side effects.
Mostly I use Chrome and sometimes Firefox. I haven't noticed any huge differences in rendering websites on these two browsers, but I realize that there are some css elements that look different in them. I think it bothers web designers the most, because they have to put a lot of effort into making a user-friendly website in this multiply browser word.
