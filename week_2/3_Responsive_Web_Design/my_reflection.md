Responsive design is a way to build a website which allows for using media queries to detect a user's screen resolution and then apply appropriate style to html, so that the layout can change depending on a device.
I think smart phones have turned the web design industry upside down and caused that it is very difficult to create user-friendly website. However, the media queries are huge help in this challenge. In my opinion in the future we will browse 3D web, so this will be a real challenge to web design.
Visually impaired people use screen readers for reading a content of web page. I think this aspect of a web development is still overlooked. Designers most of the time concentrate on a visual design and forget about other types of interaction with the web.
When I was learning about web design there were a lot of materials about User Experience, which at the beginning I thought is easy and straightforward, but I realised that it is much more complicated.
