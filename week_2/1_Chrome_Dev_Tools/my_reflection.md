# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


In my understanding the Document Object Model transforms HTML into object and as a result of it JavaScript can influence on HTML, change it, hide or add new elements.
The structure of Wordpress is much more complicated than my simple website. First thing I've noticed that there are more GET requests and also Timeline looks different, which I have to investigate and understand better.
I think that Dev Tools are very helpful tools. I used them in the past, but only for inspecting HTML and CSS, so it was big “aha”, when I saw that other things like for example website performance can be inspected as well.
It helped me to locate broken link to a background image, which I missed reviewing my website code.
